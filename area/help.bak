0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~
Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

See also help on 'stance' and 'stancetable'.
~

-1 ALIAS~
The alias system.

You are allowed to have 30 aliases. The following commands can be used.

alias       - Creates a new alias.
removealias - Removes an old alias you don't want.
showalias   - Shows all aliases that you have made.

examples :

* alias cc c 'dispel magic'

By typing cc <target>, the player now casts dispel magic on that target.
To remove this alias, a player would simply type 'removealias cc'.

Feel free to experiment with aliases.

~

8 ALLOW BAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.  
~

1 AREAS COMMANDS SOCIALS~
Syntax: areas
Syntax: commands
Syntax: socials

AREAS shows you all the areas in the game, with the author's name and the
levels of the mobs that inhabit that area.

COMMANDS shows you all the (non-social) commands available to you.

SOCIALS shows you all the social commands available to you.
~

1 ARENA~
The rules in the arena are simple :

* No use of 'safe powers', meaning no going invis, objectform, shadowplane
  or any other power that leaves you safe from attacks.

To beat another player, you must tie them with the 'tie <players>' command,
and that player will be removed from the arena and given a restore.

Last man (or woman) standing in the arena will be the winner.

The arena opens every 2 hours for normal battles, all the normal
rules apply, and the winner gets a small prize. Some of these battles
will be for base classes alone. (you can type timer to see when the next
arena will be).

Currently we are working on some nifty arena commands, and so far we have
made these commands :

* Arenastats - Shows the stats on the people in the arena.
* Arenajoin  - Let's you join the arena when it opens (happens once in a while).
* Resign     - Give up, you'll leave the arena and get an arena loss.

~

1 AUTOSTANCE~
The autostance command will enable you to choose a default stance, which
you will always drop into when starting a new fight. You must be able
to normally stance into a stance before you can autostance it.

Syntax : Autostance <stance>

~

1 AVATAR RANK~
To become an avatar, you must have 2000 hps. Then you can use the
command 'train avatar' to achive the level of avatar. Once you
have trained, you can gain a class by using the command 'selfclass'.

TIP: It is not wise to train more than 4-5000 hps before you are
ready to playerkill. You will be protected from playerkilling
untill you have reached the status of Cadet (on the who screen).

~

1 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will
not hit players, only mobiles.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.
~

0 BLINDNESS~
Syntax: cast blindness <victim>

This spell renders the target character blind.
~

1 BOMBS GRENADES TRIGGER~
The mud has bombs and grenades, to use them simply use the
trigger command, followed by the bombs name and how long you
wish to set the delay (1-3 rounds).

example : trigger grenade 2

~

1 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish <staff>
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <wand> <target>

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.
~

0 BREW SCRIBE CARVE ENGRAVE BAKE~
Syntax: cast brew <potion> <spell>
Syntax: cast scribe <scroll> <spell>
Syntax: cast carve <wand> <spell>
Syntax: cast engrave <staff> <spell>
Syntax: cast bake <pill> <spell>

These spells allow other spells to be embedded in the specified object, 
which is usually created via the 'minor creation' spell.
~

1 BRIEF6 BRIEF5 BRIEF4 BRIEF3 BRIEF2 BRIEF1~
With the command brief1, brief2, brief3, brief4, brief5 and brief6,
you can toggle how much you'll recieve from looking and combat.

brief1 -> Information when you look toggled between short/long.
brief2 -> Toggle shields, misses and weapon burn/freeze in combat.
brief3 -> Toggle dodge/parry messages in combat. (default enabled)
brief4 -> Toggle message on exp modifiers, discipline points and class points.
brief5 -> For the very sensitive persons - gives a summary of the combat.
brief6 -> Blocks all 3rd party battlespam.

~

1 BULLY~
It's not considered nice to harass players that are much weaker than yourself.
It is quite okay to mort and tie someone weaker than yourself if they talked trash,
killed your mobs or killed one of your friends, but it is not okay to constantly
harass players that are weaker than yourself simply because you feel like it.

Should a player act like a real bully, a special bullyflag will be added to that
player. Anyone with a bullyflag will show as a bully on who and have a harder time
dodging and parrying. The bully flag will be removed when that player has learned
to act like a normal person.

(Whether a player is a bully or not is decided at the discression of the immortals,
trying to get the immortals to set the bully flag on someone will result
in the bully flag being set on yourself)

We hope never to actually set the bully flag on anyone, this is afterall a playerkilling
mud, and people should expect to be morted, tied and killed; but should harassment be
taken to the extreme by a player, we will set the flag on the offending player.

~

1 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

1 CHALLENGE FORTRESS BET SPAR DEATHMATCH~
The mud has a forbidden fortress, which is used to fight one-on-one battles.

To challenge someone to a fight type : challenge <person> <spar/death>,
it is only possible to kill someone for real in a deathmatch, the spar
will just result in an arena loss/win.

To agree to a challenge, simply type agree <challenger>.

It is possible to bet questpoints on who wins a deathmatch, simply
use the command 'bet <winner> <amount>'. You can bet as long as
both players have more than 75% of their hitpoints left.

Genstealing in a deathmatch is possible, but all bets are cancelled
if the fight ends in a genteal.

0 CLAIM CALL GIFT LOCATE~
Syntax: claim <object>
Syntax: call <object>

By claiming an object (which costs 500 exp), that object becomes your 
personal property.  Using the 'locate' command you can find what items 
currently belong to you and where they are in the mud.  If you are not 
carrying the item, you can get it back by calling it with the 'call' 
command.  You can change the ownership of your own items by use of the 
'gift' command.

It should be noted that relics CANNOT be gifted.

If you are looking for help on the 'locate object' spell, you might

1 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard. Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment (unless it was claimed).

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

1 EXPERIENCE XP MODIFIERS~
Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the level of the mob being killed.
There are also different modifiers like happy hour and newbie exp.

The exp modifiers are as listed :

* Newbie hours (The first 4 hours) : gives 200 % extra exp.
* Happy (Immortals can set this)   : gives 100 % extra exp.
* Size                             : gives an unknown amount.
* Time                             : depends on how long you have been on.
* Tithe (worshippers only)         : gives  -5 % exp (that's less)
* Mccp   (read Help mccp)          : gives  -5/+25 % exp modifier.
* Alignment (explained below)      : gives  +/- 25 % exp modifier.
* Edge                             : gives 15% extra exp.

#GAlignment explaned#n
If your kill a mob of the opposite alignment as yourself, fx. if your
aligned good and you kill an evil mob, you gain 25% extra exp from
the kill. BUT if your the same alignment as the mob you get 25% LESS
exp from killing that mob.

#GGuidelines about modifiers#n
* DO NOT ask immortals to turn on Happy Hour!
* Use #ymccp#n to get the 25% extra exp, it helps the mud run smother.
    #RYou can use mccp with #yANY#R mudclient out there, please#n
    #Rread the help file on #ymcclient#R if your normal mudclient doesn't#n
    #Rsupport mccp by itself. Mcclient is NOT a client, it simply helps#n
    #Ryour normal client so it can use the mccp protocol.#n
* If you for some reason don't get a certain modifier even though your sure
  that you should get it, please recheck everything, perhaps you shouldn't
  get it afterall.

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax: cast 'fly' <character>

This spell enables the target character to fly.
~

1 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
~

7 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

1 GENERATIONS GENSTEAL~
All new chars start at generation 6, and can improve their
generation by stealing generation from other chars with same
or better (lower) generation than them self.

syntax : gensteal <victim>

victim must be morted.

Generation gives a damcap bonus.

At generation 2 your max weaponskill goes up by 10%.
At generation 1 your max weaponskill goes up by 20%.

~

1 GLAMOUR RESHAPE VTWIST CAMOUFLAGE~
Reshaping powers can be used to rename equipment, this is
the correct syntax to use for any of the reshaping commands.

reshape <targer object> [name|short] <new name>

name  : Changes the keywords of the item (that which you type to handle it)
short : This is the name shown, when you look at the item.

example for renaming a dagger to 'Purple Dagger'

reshape dagger short Purple Dagger

1 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
~

1 HELP~

1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax: HIDE
Syntax: SNEAK
Syntax: VISIBLE

If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you.  If you 
attack while hidden, the surprise attack will inflict one and a half 
times your normal damage (assuming your opponent cannot see you).

If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
being noticed.

In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

1 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

1 HOME~
To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'.  
From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).

A home cannot be a safe room.
~

1 HURL~
Syntax: hurl <name>
Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>

This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
through doors.  Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage.  
Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
doors does three times as much.  If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.

0 INFRAVISION~
Syntax: cast infravision <character>

This spell enables the target character to see in the dark.
~

1 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
This nice spell, allows you to locate any object on the mud. By giving
the name of the object as the argument to the spell, the spell will list
the first 44 objects that match your argument. If you wish to see more
than just the first 44 objects, you can give an additional argument X to
the spell, so it will skip the first X objects.

example : cast locate sword 30

This will list up to 44 swords, and their location, skipping the first
30 swords encountered on the mud.

~

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

and enabling the automap feature (type 'map'), then the room
description will include a map of the rooms around the player.

Symbols used for the map are :

#g*#n  Woodland, Forest, Plains
#8@#n  Mountain, Hill
#nO#n  Inside, City
#L=#n  Water, Ocean, Sea
#C#-#n  Air, Flying

The symbols '#o|#n' and '#o-#n' represents roads, tunnels, etc.

~

1 MASTERY~
When you have grandmasterd all your stances, spells and weapons,
you can use the mastery command to gain a mastery item, which
is a piece of classeq that's better than your normal classeq.
Mastery doesn't require that you max your superstances, nor
does it require that you have more than 200 in weapons/skills
if that's possible. Getting 200 is enough.

syntax : mastery

NOTE : If you are so stupid that you gemstone your mastery item
       it's your loss, don't expect anyone to care.

~

1 MCCP MCCLIENT~
Mccp is a compression protocol, and the two main benefits of mccp are:

1. lower bandwidth usage by the mud.
2. clients (i.e. players) get large responses (such as, for example, combat
   spam) from the mud at a higher rate - the mud will "feel" faster, despite
   the fact that the actual round-trip times are unchanged.

With a suitable client, mccp is entirely transparent to the user - it
automatically enables itself when supported by both the server and client.

For more details on the protocol, your welcome to visit the MCCP homepage

#Ghttp://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/#n

Currently the following mud clients are know to support mccp.

* Papaya
* Tkturf
* Mcl
* Amcl (cvs only)
* Kmud
* Zmud (version 6 only)
* Mushclient

If your client do not support mccp theres another way to use mccp,
the instructions on how to do this can be found on the following
page, and it takes no more than 2-3 minutes to get working.

[Insert MCCP howto page here]

If you use mccp, you will be rewarded by an extra 25% exp bonus.

~

1 MSP SOUNDS MUSIC~
MSP stands for Mud Sound Protocol, and it's a way of allowing muds
to use sounds and affects to increase the fun of mudding.

As far as I know, only wintin and zmud has support for MSP, but
should you know of any other clients that supports the sound
protocol, you can mail the admins of the mud, and they will add
it to the list of clients.

You can either download all the sounds first (that's probably
the smartest thing to do), or let your mudclient download them
when they are needed (it will only download them once, and then
reuse the downloaded sound next time it's needed).

Sounds are found at :

[Insert sound page here]

Just type 'sound' to toggly sounds on/off.

~

1 MULTIPLAYING PLAYERSHARING~
Multiplaying and playersharing is strictly forbidden, the rules
are as this (and don't try and find loopholes, I'll just wipe you).

* No more than 1 char can connect via 1 ip, so local networks
  don't work, unless you have more than one ip available.
* Going linkdead to trade items from one char to another is not
  allowed, it still counts as multiplaying.
* Having more than one person controlling a character on the mud
  is called playersharing and it not allowed.
* No transfering of items and/or qps from one char to another
  that you own, read HELP RULES on how I deal with people who
  think they found a loophole.
* No using one of your characters to help another in some way
  or another. Be smart, keep your characters seperated.
* If an immortal tells you to stop multiplaying, you will stop
  instantly, there will only be given one warning, next time
  ANYONE multiplays from that ip, ALL chars from that ip will
  be deleted.

Don't argue, if an imm tells you that your multiplaying, then
you are. We don't give a shit if it's your mother that controls
the other character.

announcements are posted. The commands used to access, read and write
on these boards, are :

* note <read|write|list>
  - read will read the next note on the board (or a given note
    for example 'note read 7').
  - write will post a new note on the board you are currently on.
    Just follow the instructions given during note creation.

This creates an identical copy of the specified object, with the only 
exceptions being that the cloned objects creator is the person creating

~

1 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~

you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

1 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

7 OTRANSFER~
Syntax: otransfer <object>
Syntax: otransfer <object> <character>

This will transfer the specified object to the specified character.  The 
character is defaulted to yourself.

~

1 PARADOX~
When a player decaps someone not in their range, they get paradox'ed,
which means they end up morted in midgaard, which really isn't healthy.
A player getting paradox'ed will also lose 10% of their MAX hps.

The range works in this way :

Each player has a certain powerscore assigned to them, and this score will
go up (or down) as this player gets more powerful, these are the things that
affect how powerful you are in regard to the powerscore :

* How many hitpoints you have (max hps, not current).
* If you have mastery or not.
* How many superstances you have (0 to 5).
* Whether your an upgrade or not.
* A small change for the amount of rune a player may have.
* Spell affects like trains or blesses should will not affect this score.

If you decap someone which are not within your range, you get a paradoxcounter,
should you ever get 3 of these counters you will be struck by paradox. You can
only get rid of counters by decapping players within your range.

Also read PARADOXSTATS.

~

1 PARADOXSTATS~
Taking a base in hps, the paradoxrange looks at a number calculated from the following.

* Each skill mastered (weapons, stances, spells) gives a small modifier,
  a fully mastered player get's a 10K total modifier.
* Superstances counts as 5K hps a piece. (25K hps when you have ss5).

If a player doesn't have more than 15K now, we don't add anything else.
  #G(#yactually a player with less than 15K can't be killed nor kill#G)#n
But if the player has more than 15K we take a look at the following.

* Possible Rune eq counts as 1K hps a piece for a max of 14 (yes, 14K).
* Being an upgrade will modify this number in a special way :)
* Each extra level beyond level 1 as upgrade counts as an extra 12K hps.

We then compare the number of the attacker and the defender, deciding
whether the attacker is allowed to decap or not.

And no, I will not explain this any better, if you don't understand, then
you'll just have to live with not understanding.

~

0 'PASS DOOR'~

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
~

are usualy used to buy new powers, but some powers might require that
the player spend a certain amount of class points each time the power 
is used.

~

-1 POLICY~

I suggest writing a fitting policy for your mud

~

0 PORTAL~
Syntax: cast portal <victim>

This spell creates a magical portal between the caster and the target.  
The portal remains in existance for 2 or 3 hours (mud time), during which 
time anyone can 'enter' the portal on one side and come out on the other.
~

1 POWERS~
To see a list of all the commands available to your class, simply use
the command 'powers'. This will list all general class powers, and
should your class use disciplines, then it will also show any discipline
powers that you have already learned.

~

1 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability in all the 
skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  Unused sessions are saved until you do use them.
~

1 PRIMAL~
Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
from which all other energies are derived.  Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
primal energy is only one use, and is generally used for very powerful 
spells and abilitites.
~

1 PROMPT CPROMPT~
This command allows you to configure your prompt.  The PROMPT command 
will set your standard prompt.  You also have the option of having a 
combat prompt, CPROMPT, which will appear while fighting.  If no cprompt 
is defined, the standard prompt will be used for both conditions.
The following options are available:

%b %B = Beast/Blood.                %f %F = Condition of opponent/tank. 
%h %H = Current hp/Max hp.          %t %T = Current Fighttimer/Stance.
%m %M = Current mana/Max mana.      %n %N = Name of opponent/tank.      
%p %P = Hitroll/Plus Damroll.       %q %Q = Quest/Class points.
%r %R = Room name/Rage.             %k %K = Class special 1/2 (if any)
%x %X = Exp./Linebreak              %c %C = Class special 3/4 (if any)
%v %V = Current move/Max move.      %y %Y = Class special 5/6 (if any)
%a %A = Special Cond. of opponent (with or without colors)

( for class specials, you should refer to the class own help file, it
  will tell you if any of the specials are available for that class   )

To switch your prompt on and off, use 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.
For some examples, type 'help prompts'.
~

1 PROMPTS~
There are many possible prompts, and everyone will have their own 
favoured setups.  However, to get you going, here are some examples:

Original normal prompt: [%x exp] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Original combat prompt: [%f] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]
Vampire prompt: [%B Blood] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Werewolf prompt: [%R Rage] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Combat prompt: [%N:%F/%n:%f]
Stat prompt: [%xX] [+%pHIT/+%PDAM] [%cAC] [%hH/%mM/%vV]

Remember, you can switch between the default prompts and your customised
prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.
~

0 PROTECTION SANCTUARY~
Syntax: cast protection
Syntax: cast sanctuary  <character>


The PROTECTION spell reduces the damage taken from any attack by an evil
creature by one quarter.

The SANCTUARY spell reduces the damage taken by the character from any attack
by one half.

These spells may be used simultaneously for cumulative effect.
~

1 QUEST QUESTMASTERS~
A new quest system is in town, and the old one is out. Here is
a short list of commands used (for more details you should read
the quest help on my homepage).

qgain <questmaster>       - gain a new quest from a questmaster.
qcomplete <questmaster>   - get the prize for completing the quest.
showquest                 - lists all quests you are doing.

An example: Find a questmaster, type 'qgain <name of questmaster>',
then type 'showquest'. In this example we will assume that the
quest is a quest to find and slay a specific monster. After finding
the monster (it will have a quest-flag next to it's name), return
to the questmaster and type 'qcomplete <name of questmaster>'. The
questmaster will give you a questtoken, which you should eat, it
will increase your questpool.

~

1 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and objects.  You must be a mortal or avatar to
save.  The game will auto-save your character every few minutes whether you
save or not.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere, although there is an experience
penalty for quitting outside of Midgaard.  When you re-enter the game you will
be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

-1 RAGNAROK~
#0RAGNAROK MODE#n

When time comes, the world will sunder and the gods will walk the earth
spreading havoc and destruction, this is a time of slaughter, and no one
will be safe, this is the age of Ragnarok.

Using the command 'mudstat' you'll be able to tell if ragnarok is on,
if it's not, you'll just get the normal mudstat screen.

Doing ragnarok the following changes are in effect :

* There are no safe rooms.
* Everyone has scry, and it bypasses all shields.
* You can decap anyone, anywhere. (no paradox).
* Heads will vanish faster.
* Players will auto train avatar and get a restore.
* Upgrades can only fight other upgrades.
* You do not lose ANYTHING if capped during ragnarok.
* Base classes can only fight other base classes.
* You are safe for 3 ticks after training avatar. (to rewear)

player can turn on ragarok buy pooling qps toward it, using
the ragnarok command. ie. 'ragnarok 200' will add 200 qps

8 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.

So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

2 SELFDELETE DELETE~
It is possible to delete your char and start over if that is what you want.
Simply type 'selfdelete <your password>' and you will be deleted.

1 SETLOGIN SETLOGOUT SETAVATAR SETTIE SETDECAP~
With these commands you can set the message other players gets when you enter
or leave the game, as well as train avatar. Each time you set this message,

you shouldn't have any trouble following them.

* No profanities in the message.
* No referring to any of the immortals or other players besides the possible victim.
* I'll remove your ability to change your messages if you abuse this in any way.

The syntax is easy, heres a few examples :

settie $n grins in triumph as $e ties up $N.

Heres the syntax :

  $n  This is your name.
  $N  This is the name of the possible victim.

disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

1 SUPERSTANCES SETSTANCE~
When you have grandmastered all you normal stances, you can create your
own stances with the setstance command. The setstance command will tell
you how to create a new stance, and how much xp it costs; but beware,
once you have finished your superstance, your stuck with it forever.

example on creating superstance one would be :

setstance dodge               (20 mill exp)
setstance damcap lesser       (20 mill exp)
setstance resist lesser       (20 mill exp)
setstance done

This would buy a superstance with dodge, damcap and toughness,
costing a total of 60 million exp.

Minimum and Maximum amount of experience that can be spend on the creation
of a superstance depends on what superstance it it.

SS1    Min :  40 mill.     Max : 240 mill.
SS2    Min :  80 mill.     Max : 280 mill.
SS3    Min : 120 mill.     Max : 300 mill.
SS4    Min : 160 mill.     Max : 360 mill.
SS5    Min : 200 mill.     Max : 380 mill.

0 TELEPORT~
Syntax: cast <teleport>

This spell takes you from your current location to a random location somewhere
in the world.
~

1 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

for these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~
Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>

incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.
~

1 TITLE~

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a title when your character is created.  You can use

#C Captain#n
#R Master#n
#y Legendary#n
#G Hero#n
#L Adventurer#n
#r Veteran#n
#y Private#n
#o Cadet#n
#p Wannabe#n

Each rank beyond Wannabe gains an extra 10% exp bonus from killing mobs,
and people with Wannabe rank cannot pk. The title itself is based on the
might of that player (Hitpoints, upgradestatus, skills with weapons, stances,
spells, and alot of other stuff).

~

Syntax: train <slash/stab/smash/beast/grab>
Syntax: train <charm/heat/cold/lightning/acid/sleep/drain/voodoo>
Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the 
second, 30000 for the third, and so on.
~

0 TRANSPORT~
Syntax: cast transport <object> <character>

This spell will transport the specified object from your inventory to

through most illusions, as well as see in the dark. Always remember
to enable your truesight power.

~

8 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

7 USERS~
Syntax: users

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the channel
number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in merc.h:
0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.
~

0 VOODOO~
Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~

1 VOTE POLL~
The mud has a voting system. Just remember, this is not a democracy,
and any final rulings will be made by me.

To vote, you need to be at least 10 hours old, and have killed 1000
mobs; also you can only vote once (ie. no alts) - if you try to use an
alt, any votes you have cast will simply be removed.

Type 'vote' to get a list of current polls. To vote on any of the polls
simply follow this example : Theres a poll called 'mages', and you want
to cast your vote on the 2nd option, so you type 'vote mages 2'.

Can it be any simpler ?

~

1 VT100~
If your client supports the vt100 protocol, you can make your
prompt stay at the bottom of your screen permanent. This is
done by typing 'vt100' while standing in a safe room. The mud
will then talk to your mudclient, asking it for your screen
size. If your client responds, the mud will figure out where
on your screen it should "trap" your prompt.

To disable vt100, simply type vt100 again (this can be done
anywhere, so you don't need a safe room for this).

~

1 WHERE~
Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

1 WHO~
Typing who will show a list of the players online that you can see, using the following style :

#p  Title#n      #y(#Gx.xx#y)#n     #0<<#RCLASS#0>>#n         PlayerName      #C-= #PFAITH #C=-#n

* The Title is based on the players size, and who is sorted somewhat after this.
  The lowest title is 'Wannabe' and they cannot kill nor be killed by other players.
  If your a wannabe and want to pk, then you need to grow in size first, this is
  done by either training more hitpoints or training more skills (weapons, stances, etc).

* The (x.xx) is the pkratio of that player, and the colors around the numbers shows
  whether you can kill that player and if she/he can kill you, heres the deal :

  if the #R()#n's are red, that means you can #Gboth#n kill eachother.
  if the #0()#n's are black, that means that the player can #Gkill you#n, but you can't kill him/her.
  if the #y()#n's are yellow, that means you can #Gkill them#n, but they can't kill you.
  if the #L()#n's are blue, #Gneither#n of you can kill eachother.

* The Class and PlayerName are obvious.

* The religion tag will show what god/deity that player worships, and will also show
  the rank of that player within the given Church/Coven.

Enjoy!
