This is the README file for the Dystopia 1.4.x codebase.

I suggest giving this link to your builders, it's the
guide for the OLC (online area building tool).

http://www.daimi.au.dk/~jobo/dystopia/OLC-Guide/

Besides that, this codebase is not supported in any way.

Brian Graversen, author of the codebase (jobo@daimi.au.dk)
