I don't know what did it, but I put flameblade (1500 primal), caust, immolate
and weaponenhance (1500 primal).  I put 3000 primal into this thing
then not long after "(Ancient> An [IVORY} handled Bastard Sword
turns to fine dust and blows away."
What is up with that shit?
oh yeah also used poisonblade.
