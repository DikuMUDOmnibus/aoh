Xrakisis~
Dec 27~
began the process of seting every object in
                            the game with their corresponding material
                            number~

                            far as setting materials~
Xrakisis~
12/29/2010~
i wrote a destroy command.. this will let
                            you harvest the material type of an item,
                            for a fraction of its weight~
Xrakisis~
12/29/2010~
i wrote a materials command, to list the amounts
                            of raw materials you have~
Xrakisis~
01/02/2011~
now obj->c_material, the variable for components
                            saves~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
now when you destroy an object that has more
                            than one material it reimburses you the weight
                            of each of the materials~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
now each material type, when forged, has its
                            own affect~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~

                            file~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
now the strength of the 2 materials being
                            forged is the objects toughness~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
items are no longer autoset toughness 100.
                            So now the material toughness is what counts~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
worked on help materials some more~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~
now you take less damage if the wear location
                            has a strong piece of armor on it~
Xrakisis~
01/03/2011~

                            easier, LB_GEM 1, LB_OTHER 2, LB_METAL 5~
Xrakisis~
01/05/2011~
put in the affects of all the forgeable materials
                            in the materials command~
Xrakisis~
01/05/2011~
now there are three sets of defines for materials.
                            copper for excample:M_COPPER for 1,2,3,4.
                            C_COPPER for bits, 2,4,8 and T_COPPER for
                            the toughness that should be applied to the
                            forged item~
Xrakisis~
01/05/2011~
added 'the object toughness applied' to the
                            materials command.. find the 2 materials
                            your going to forge, then add the toughness
                            numbers.. its good to get the result as clost
                            to 100 as possible~
Xrakisis~
01/11/2011~
